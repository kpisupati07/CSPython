# PROBLEM: Write function modify that will take a string as input and
# return the string with every other word capitalized.  For exmaple:
# "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" Should become "THE
# quick BROWN fox JUMPS over THE lazy DOG"
#
# Use split and join in your function.

def modify(text):
    ???

def main():
    saying = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
    print(modify(saying))
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
